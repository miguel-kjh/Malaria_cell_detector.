Comparison between a CNN and a VGG16 for the diagnosis of malaria.Using Keras
This practice has been based on the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria.

The aim is to identify between malaria-infected and healthy cells, more specifically red blood cells. To this end, we compare the results of a network based on VGG16 and a CNN adapted to the problem. To achieve decent results the dense layer has been replaced and the weights of some intermediate convolutional layers have been recalculated. Because the VGG16 with the imagenet dataset weights are not adequate weights to be able to identify the infected area of the globules. Approximately 94% accuracy and validation is achieved. Several layers of maxpooling are introduced to characterize the most characteristic zones and patterns of the images. Several dropout layers are also introduced to reduce possible overfitting. Approximately 92% of acurracy and validation is achieved.
